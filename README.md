# google-homepage
Google homepage copy by William Xia

Description:
This project is a clone of the google homepage. The fonts and logo were copied directly from the homepage, but the rest of the page was created from scratch.

What I Learned:
I used a float to keep the right side of the header glued to the right side of the page. Looking back I could have done this in a few other ways, including absolute positioning or with flex. 

I played around with box shadow for a long time until I replicated the actual gray shadow underneath the search bar. 

I learned how to style the input bar (search bar) and how to add padding to one side. 

I learned how to semantically separate elements such as the header, main body, and footer.
